# A PyNN interface to GeNN
This project bridges [GeNN](http://genn-team.github.io/genn/), a GPU enhanced Neuronal Network simulation environment, with [PyNN](https://pypi.org/project/PyNN/), a simulator-independent language for building neuronal network models.

## Installation
 1. Follow the instructions in https://github.com/genn-team/genn/blob/master/pygenn/README.md to install PyGeNN.
 2. Clone this project
 3. Install with setuptools using ``python setup.py develop`` command

## Bugs
- PyNN GeNN is still under development - current results of running PyNN system tests are outlined in [#8](https://github.com/genn-team/pynn_genn/issues/8) with links to outstanding issues causing test failures.
