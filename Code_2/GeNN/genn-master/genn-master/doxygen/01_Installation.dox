/*! \page Installation Installation

You can download GeNN either as a zip file of a stable release or a
snapshot of the most recent stable version or the unstable development
version using the Git version control system.

\section Downloading Downloading a release
Point your browser to \a https://github.com/genn-team/genn/releases
and download a release from the list by clicking the relevant source
code button. Note that GeNN is only distributed in the form of source
code due to its code generation design. Binary distributions would not
make sense in this framework and hence are not provided. 
After downloading continue to install GeNN as described in the \ref installing section below.

\section GitSnapshot Obtaining a Git snapshot

If it is not yet installed on your system, download and install Git
(\a http://git-scm.com/).Then clone the GeNN repository from Github
\code
git clone https://github.com/genn-team/genn.git
\endcode
The github url of GeNN in the command above can be copied from the
HTTPS clone URL displayed on the GeNN Github page (\a https://github.com/genn-team/genn).

This will clone the entire repository, including all open branches.
By default git will check out the master branch which contains the
source version upon which the next release will be based. There are other 
branches in the repository that are used for specific development 
purposes and are opened and closed without warning.

An alternative to using git is to download the full content of
GeNN sources by clicking on the "Download ZIP" button on the bottom right
of the GeNN Github page (\a https://github.com/genn-team/genn).

\section installing Installing GeNN

Installing GeNN comprises a few simple steps to create the GeNN
development environment:
\note
While GeNN models are normally simulated using CUDA on NVIDIA GPUs, if you want to use GeNN on a machine without an NVIDIA GPU, you can skip steps v and vi and use GeNN in "CPU_ONLY" mode.

(i) If you have downloaded a zip file, unpack GeNN.zip in a convenient
location. Otherwise enter the directory where you downloaded the Git
repository.

(ii) Add GeNN's "bin" directory to your path, e.g. if you are running Linux or Mac OS X and extracted/downloaded GeNN to
     $HOME/GeNN, then you can add:
      \code
      export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/GeNN/bin
      \endcode
       to your login script (e.g. `.profile` or `.bashrc`). If you are using
     WINDOWS, the path should be a windows path as it will be
     interpreted by the Visual C++ compiler `cl`, and environment
     variables are best set using `SETX` in a Windows cmd window.
     To do so, open a Windows cmd window by typing `cmd` in the search
     field of the start menu, followed by the `enter` key.
     In the `cmd` window type:
      \code
      setx PATH "C:\Users\me\GeNN\bin;%PATH%"
      \endcode 
      where `C:\Users\me\GeNN` is the path to your GeNN directory.

(iv) Install the C++ compiler on the machine, if not already present.
     For Windows, download Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition from
     \a https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx.
     When installing Visual Studio, one should select the 'Desktop 
    development with C++' configuration and the 'Windows 8.1 SDK' and 'Windows 
    Universal CRT' individual components.
     Mac users should download and set up Xcode from
     \a https://developer.apple.com/xcode/index.html
     , Linux users should install the GNU compiler collection gcc and g++
     from their Linux distribution repository, or alternatively from
     \a https://gcc.gnu.org/index.html
     
(v) If your machine has a GPU and you haven't installed CUDA already, 
    obtain a fresh installation of the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit from
    \a https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
    Again, be sure to pick CUDA and C++ compiler versions which are compatible
    with each other. The latest C++ compiler need not necessarily be
    compatible with the latest CUDA toolkit.

(vi) Set the `CUDA_PATH` variable if it is not already set by the
    system, by putting
    \code
    export CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda
    \endcode
    in your login script (or, if CUDA is installed in a non-standard
    location, the appropriate path to the main CUDA directory). 
    For most people, this will be done by the CUDA install script and
    the default value of /usr/local/cuda is fine. In Windows, usually CUDA_PATH
    is already set after installing the CUDA toolkit. If not,
    set this variable with:
    \code
    setx CUDA_PATH C:\path\to\cuda
    \endcode

This normally completes the installation. Windows users must close
and reopen their command window to ensure variables set using `SETX`
are initialised.

If you are using GeNN in Windows, the Visual Studio development
environment must be set up within every instance of the CMD.EXE command
window used. One can open an instance of CMD.EXE with the development
environment already set up by navigating to Start - All Programs - 
Microsoft Visual Studio - Visual Studio Tools - x64 Native Tools Command Prompt. You may also wish to
create a shortcut for this tool on the desktop, for convenience.

\section pygenn Installing PyGeNN
Building PyGeNN is a little involved so we recommend installing a prebuilt binary wheel from our Releases page or direct from our <a href="https://gen-ci.inf.sussex.ac.uk/job/GeNN/job/genn/job/master/">build server</a>.

\subsection pygenn_wheel Installing PyGeNN from binary wheels
 - Select a suitable wheel from the Releases page (all wheels are build for CUDA 10 except for on Mac OS which is built for CUDA 9). For example, if you have a Linux system with Python 3.7 you would pick ``pygenn-0.2.1-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl``. If you do not have CUDA installed, ignore the CUDA version and pick the wheel that otherwise matches your platform.
 - Install the wheel using pip:
 \code
 pip install pygenn-0.2.1-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
 \endcode
 
\subsection pygenn_source_nix Installing PyGeNN from source on Linux or Mac OSX
 - Navigate to the GeNN directory and build a dynamic library version of GeNN, directly into the PyGeNN directory with:
 \code
 make DYNAMIC=1 LIBRARY_DIRECTORY=`pwd`/pygenn/genn_wrapper/
 \endcode
 - Build the Python extension with setup tools with: 
 \code
 python setup.py develop
 \endcode
 
\subsection pygenn_source_windows Installing PyGeNN from source on Windows
 - Ensure that you have at least Python 3.5 and Visual Studio 2015 installed (extensions for earlier versions of Python cannot be built using any versions of Visual Studio new enough to support C++11). If you are using Visual Studio 2019, you need at least Python 3.7.5. These instructions assume that the Anaconda platform was used to install Python, but it _should_ be possible to install PyGeNN using suitable versions of Python installed in different way (please let us know if you suceed in doing so!)
 - This process requires a command prompt with the environment correctly configured for both Visual Studio **and** Anaconda. To create one, launch an "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" from your chosen version of Visual Studio's start menu folder and _activate_ your chosen version of Anaconda by running the ``activate.bat`` in its ``Scripts`` directory. For example, if your user is called "me" and Anaconda is installed in your home directory, you would run:
 \code
 c:\Users\Me\Anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat c:\Users\Me\Anaconda3
 \endcode
 - From this command prompt, install SWIG using the ``conda install swig`` command.
 - Navigate to the GeNN directory and build GeNN as a dll with:
 \code
 msbuild genn.sln /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release_DLL
 \endcode
 (if you don't have CUDA installed, building the CUDA backend will fail but it should still build the CPU backend).
 - Copy the newly built DLLs into pygenn using:
 \code
 copy /Y lib\genn*Release_DLL.* pygenn\genn_wrapper
 \endcode
 - Build the Python extension with setup tools with
 \code
 python setup.py develop
 \endcode
